Description:
Game of Life is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. It's a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules. This program is built using the Scene module in Pythonista, providing an interactive and visual representation of the game.

Features:
Interactive user interface for playing and exploring the Game of Life.
Toggle cells, reset the board, play, pause, step through generations, and randomize the initial state.
Visual indication of cell states and generation progression.
Adjustable board size and update rate.
Cellular automaton rules based on neighboring cells.

Requirements:
Pythonista (iOS app) for running the program.
scene module for the interactive graphical user interface.
Usage:

Open the Pythonista app.
Copy and paste the provided code into a new Python script.
Run the script using the Pythonista environment.
Interact with the GUI buttons to control the simulation.
